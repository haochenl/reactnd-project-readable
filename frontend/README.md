This is an application created with React and Redux. This projects demonstrates the understanding of the
Redux library and how to better manage application state by deciding when to use data from Component State or Redux Store.

Here is how you can load the application onto your local machine:

* First, install node.js if you do not have it yet. It comes with npm(node package manage).
Make sure that you install node with the PATH variable so you can run node anywhere in your command prompt/terminal.
* The environment is now ready. After installing the react package, you can either clone this repo or download it as a zip. if you download this as a zip, you will have to extract the files.
* in your command prompt/terminal, change directory to the server root(where you cloned/extracted the repo) and run: npm install -> then run: node server
* in your command prompt/terminal, change directory to the project root(where you cloned/extracted the repo).
* to start the react app, run this command: npm start
* This will start the app in your default browser at: localhost:3000
